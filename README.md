# Showcase-Android

Showcase-Android is an incredibly simple sample of how I make Android applications.  
This app has two separate implementations, each based on an architectural pattern of either  
<b>Model-View-Presenter</b> <small><i>AKA</i></small> <b>MVP</b>  
or  
<b>Model-View-ViewModel</b> <small><i>AKA</i></small> <b>MVVM</b>  
On inspection of the source code you'll notice the project is completely based on Kotlin, and uses RxJava where observers are required (Network requests, EditText updates etc.).    
I plan on updating this application regularly to ensure it keeps up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies.  
  
Check back later to see how it develops.
